# YouTube Downloader
This is a text based application that you can use to download music and video from youtube. To download the release you should click to the link that is located under releases header on the right side of the page. Click to the latest release and download the executable file.  

## IMPORTANT
If you are having issues with downloading musics/videos using the ".exe" file. Something with YouTube or, with PyTube may have been changed. In this case, I recommend reinstallation of PyTube and usage of the source code.

### Reinstall PyTube
```
pip remove pytube
pip install pytube
```

### Run the application from the source code
```
python youtube_downloader_nt_2.00.py
```
Or
```
youtube_downloader_nt_2.00.py
```
